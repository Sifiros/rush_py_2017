Subject:
    You have to write a program that take the content of a csv file given as parameter.
    You have to dump the equivalent of the csv file as a yml file (same name finishing by .yml) and json file (finishing by .json). While dumping you have to create for each keys, a list of values.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Hint:
    csv
    json
    yaml
=======
	For this exercise you are required to provide prettylog.py, an 
executable that will parse a log file given as parameter and to display it in
a prettyfied fashion.

	By default, standard output will be used.
 
	Below are the prettifying rules you must follow depending on the 
severity level:

        * INFO will be in green
        * DEBUG will be in blue
        * FATAL will be in red
        * ALERT will be in yellow

	For the colors we provide you with the class Colors in Color.py.

	You'll have to handle multiple parameters:

	prettylog.py -i filepath [-w matchword] [-l sevlevel] [-f file]

	-i|--input Is the path of the input file
	-w|--word Indicates that only the lines whose log sentence include
matchword will be dislayed
it won't match datas like level and date.
	-l Indicates that only the lines whose severity level are sevlevel
	-f Is the path of the output file

FILENAME : ex07.py

Example:

	25/10/2015 [INFO] all your base are belong to us
>>>>>>> b0e66473db236bb4bf96f6a3f5de8ee27d0d8850

Exemple of csv file:
 Lead,Title,Phone,Notes
 Jim Grayson,Senior Manager,(555)761-2385,"Spoke Tuesday, he's interested"
 Prescilla Winston,Development Director,(555)218-3981,said to call again next week
 Melissa Potter,Head of Accounts,(555)791-3471,"Not interested, gave referral"
