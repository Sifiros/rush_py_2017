Subject:
    You have to program an http client that connects on localhost:8081
    The program parameter will be a path on the server.
    With a GET request on this path, you'll get a JSON object containing 2 values:
    	 - future
	 - past
    You have to output the days diffence between future and past.

FILENAME : ex13.py

Hint:
    datetime
    http.client

To test we will give you a server IP during the rush.
